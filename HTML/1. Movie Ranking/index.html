      <h3>1. Aashiqui 2</h3>
      <p>
        This is my all-time favorite movie. It deeply connects with my emotions every time I watch it.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="second-movie">
      <h3>2. Ok Jaanu</h3>
      <p>
        Another top favorite. Shraddha Kapoor's portrayal of Tara is beautifulâ€”she reflects my ideal when it comes to love.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="third-movie">
      <h3>3. Rockstar</h3>
      <p>
        This movie is close to my heart. Ranbir Kapoor delivered what I believe is his best performance yet.
